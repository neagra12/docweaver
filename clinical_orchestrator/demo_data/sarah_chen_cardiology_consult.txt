CARDIOLOGY CONSULTATION NOTE

Patient Name: Sarah Chen
Date of Birth: 03/15/1974
MRN: 12345678
Consultation Date: 2026-01-28

Referring Provider: Dr. Michael Rodriguez, Internal Medicine

REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Evaluation following ER visit for chest pain, rule out cardiac etiology

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
52-year-old female with Type 2 Diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia referred for cardiac evaluation following recent ER visit for chest pain. Patient presented to ER 1/22 with left-sided chest pain, ultimately diagnosed with costochondritis after ruling out ACS. Patient reports complete resolution of chest pain with ibuprofen. No current symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (6 years, A1C trend: 6.5% → 6.8%)
- Hypertension (well-controlled on lisinopril)
- Hyperlipidemia (LDL recently increased to 145)

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
- Metformin 1000mg BID
- Lisinopril 20mg daily (ACE inhibitor)
- Aspirin 81mg daily
- Ibuprofen 600mg TID PRN (started in ER)

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital Signs: BP 132/82, HR 72, RR 14
Cardiovascular: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
No peripheral edema
Pulses intact bilaterally

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
No current chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, orthopnea, or PND

ASSESSMENT:
1. Chest pain - consistent with costochondritis, NOT cardiac
2. Low cardiac risk based on negative workup
3. Diabetes with multiple cardiovascular risk factors requiring optimization

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Cardiac etiology effectively ruled out
2. No stress test needed at this time
3. If chest pain recurs, consider stress test
4. Recommend statin therapy for LDL optimization given diabetes diagnosis
5. Continue current cardiac medications
6. CAUTION: Concurrent use of ibuprofen with ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) may affect kidney function - recommend limiting NSAID use

PLAN:
Patient reassured regarding cardiac status. Will defer further cardiac workup unless symptoms recur. Recommend follow-up with primary care for lipid management and diabetes optimization.

Follow-up: PRN or if symptoms recur
